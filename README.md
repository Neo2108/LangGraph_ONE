Node: No memory, no complex logic, linear processing only (LLM)

RAG Pipeline: External knowledge present, Context awareness present, Still linear flow present

Graph Architecture: Parallel processing enabled, conditional branching, state management, and there is a human-in-the-loop
multi-agent collaboration

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple agents -> Single task
Conditional Agents -> Decision points, branching logic
Multi-agent Systems -> Collaborative, coordinated workflows

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGENT CONTROL Vs. RELIABILITY TRADE-OFF:
- Router Agent: High reliability, low control level
- Autonomous Agents: High control level, low reliability
- LangGraph: Provides a good balance between both

LangGraph: Framework for buliding stateful, multi-agent applications with LLMs, using graph-based workflows
-> State management, Graph Architecture, Multi-agent, Human-in-the-loop
